## Source distribution

This section explains how to compile Enki from the source distribution.

### Prerequisites

To compile Enki and programs who depend on it, you need:
* a working and fairly recent c++ compiler
* CMake
* A build environment compatible with CMake.

### Compilation under Unix

Those short instructions assume that you want to use "make" to build Enki.
If you want to use another build environment, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, please refer to [cmake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/).
Once you have downloaded and extracted the source distribution, you can create the Makefiles by running:

	cmake .

and then build Enki by running:

	make

You can also change the build options by running:

	ccmake .

or

	cmake-gui .

prior to cmake.

### Use

To use the library with a project using CMake, add these lines in your project:

	find_package(enki REQUIRED)

Then you can include the Enki directory with:

	include_directories(${enki_INCLUDE_DIR})

And link to the library, and optionally its viewer, by:

	target_link_libraries(YOUR_TARGET ${enki_VIEWER_LIBRARIES} ${enki_LIBRARY} ...)

Inside your code, include Enki and the viewer using:

	#include <enki/PhysicalEngine.h>
	#include <viewer/Viewer.h>
